**WELCOME TO TKOS**  


This is a 32-Bit Kernel I'm currently developing in my free time to understand Operating Systems at a deeper level and apply the knowledge I learn in school into this project.

Some of the programming languages/technologies I'm currently using are:  

1. Assembly -> x86 Architecture
2. GCC -> Compiler Collection
3. QEMU -> Hardware Virtualization
4. VirtualBox -> For Ubuntu OS


Some of the features I created in this project so far are:  
1. 16-Bit Bootloader (Initial stage complete).


Features that I'm currently building:
1. Filesystem (FAT12/16)
2. User Interface
3. Basic Commands -> ls, cd, mkdir
4. Basic Kernel


Some pictures I've included to keep track of my progress:
